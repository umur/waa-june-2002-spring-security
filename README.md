# Lab 5 - Spring Security

You can continue to your last lab assignment to add security with `JWT` to your project.

###  Requirements
--- 
* There are two roles `admin` and `appUser`.
	* `admin` can access all endpoints.
	*  `appUser` can access only `/products` endpoint.
* Use `UserDetailsService` to load the appUser from the database.
* Create `UaaController` to implement `signin` and `signup` endpoints.
* Make necessary changes to set `user_id` in `product` with the current request holder's appUser id when `saveProducts` is invoked.
	* You can access the current request holder via `SecurityContextHolder`.
* Generated token should be valid for 15 minutes. 
* Use `AOP` to filter out any offensive words.
	* You can use any kind of offensive words dictionary or you can even create one for testing.
	* Assuming `spring` is an offensive word and if the input is : `springing`, it should be filtered out as `******ing`.
		* Create `WaaOffensiveWords` aspect.
	* If the same appUser sends more than 5 different requests that contain offensive words in last 30 minutes, do not accept the requests of this appUser for next 15 minutes and return the error message `Max Bad Words Requests Limit has been Reached. You need wait for X minutes.` Change `X` with remaining time of the ban.
		* This implementation should be `stateless`. You cannot hold any data in the server's memory. You can design table/tables to implement this feature.
		* To practice further (optional), you can use `redis` instead of using `PostgreSQL`.
		* Create `WaaRequestFilter` aspect.
* Continue to your UI project and implement `signin` and `signup` functionality.
* Make necessary changes in your UI project to communicate with backend server.
	* Send the token in each request except for `signin` and `signup` functions.
	* You can store the token in the`localStorage`.
### Technical Details
---
* Use n-tier software architecture model.
* Use DTOs.
* PostgreSQL is recommended as a Relational Database system.
* Populate your database with dummy data using `data.sql`.


## Submission

* Fork this repository and push your changes.
* Once you finished your project, send a Pull Request. (Send only one Pull Request once you finish the assignment.)

### Important Notes
---

 * You are not allowed to share codes with your classmates. If detected, you will get NC.
 * **For pairs:**
	 * Individual's work will be checked from the commits.
	 *  Share tasks evenly and fairly.
	 *  To have a clearer understanding of pair programming:
		 *  > **Pair programming** is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the _driver_, writes code while the other, the _observer_ or _navigator_ reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. 
		 * [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming#:~:text=Pair%20programming%20is%20an%20agile,two%20programmers%20switch%20roles%20frequently.)

-   Remember to respect the code honor submission policy. All written code must be original. Presenting something as oneâ€™s own work when it came from another source is plagiarism and is forbidden.
    
-   Plagiarism is a very serious thing in all American academic institutions and is guarded against vigilantly by every professor.
